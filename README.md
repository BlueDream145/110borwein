# 110borwein
Epitech Project, MATHS 110

Subject:

In 2001, the Borwein brothers studied integrals that now bear their name.
Some decades ago, an old-school mathemacian would have had to hand-calculate the values of the first integrals (it
would need some months, or even years), then suppose all the integrals equal π 2 , and finally try and demonstrate this
conjecture.
You are not that kind of person.
Today, we use numerical calculus to know a many values of these integrals as possible before getting into a demon-
stration ; this is the goal of this project.
You have to compute Borwein integrals, using the rectangle method, the trapezoidal rule and the Simpson rule, and
print both the I n and the difference between this value and π 2 .

Usage:

./110borwein n

n     constant defining the integral to be computed
